# First Step: Get the Parts

My dad and I have been wanting to build a remote-controlled quad/tri copter for a while, so I decided for Christmas I would order the parts we would need to build one. I don't really know anything about RC copters so some of the parts may not be correct. We'll see how it goes!

I decided to base the design off of Flite Test's [BatBone](https://www.flitetest.com/articles/bat-bone "Flite Test BatBone") frame. The rest of the parts I sourced from HobbyKing. The best flight controller seems to be the KK2.0 board so I decided on that one. I had to make an educated guess on the brushless motors and rotors based on articles I read. I then got electronic speed controllers (ESCs) that could handle the load of the motors.

We are hoping to build the copter over the holidays and I will make a post with pictures after we make some progress.
