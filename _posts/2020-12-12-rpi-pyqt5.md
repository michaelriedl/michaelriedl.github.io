I have been wanting to build an actual dashboard for the SMRT CLK project but never have gotten around to it. I decided to start working on the dashboard recently and wanted to build it in Python with PyQt.

```
pip3 install PyQt5
Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
      File "/usr/lib/python3.7/tokenize.py", line 447, in open
        buffer = _builtin_open(filename, 'rb')
    FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/tmp/pip-install-l9pwfk8o/PyQt5/setup.py'
    
    ----------------------------------------
Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-install-l9pwfk8o/PyQt5/
```

The install command that I finally got to work is shown below.
```
sudo apt-get install qt5-default pyqt5-dev pyqt5-dev-tools
```
