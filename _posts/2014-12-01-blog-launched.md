# Launching the blog!

Today I am launching my blog. The point of this blog is to keep track of and share the projects I am working on. I also want to document lessons learned along the way in hopes that someone else can benefit from the things I've learned. The projects will range from electronics, programming, machine learning, and even home improvement.
