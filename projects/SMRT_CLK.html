        <h5>Motivation</h5>
        <p>My motivation for this project was born out of my work on The Ark. The Ark and my other handheld projects started to stall out due to the lack of a suffieciently powerful battery charge/boost circuit. However, I really liked the screen I used in that project and wanted to use it again. So to avoid the battery circuit problem and reuse the screen, I came up with the idea of the SMRT CLK.</p>
        <p>My favorite part about the SMRT CLK is its potential for customization. The form factor fits nicely on your desk and has both WiFI and a very responsive touch screen. Simple software is all that is needed to for a custom use case.</p>
